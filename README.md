3. Check the service health:

```
curl http://localhost:8080/__health | jq
```

## Build and deployment

* Built by Jenkins on new tag creation and uploaded to Docker Hub: [coco/annotations-publisher](https://hub.docker.com/r/coco/annotations-publisher/)
* CI provided by CircleCI: [annotations-publisher](https://circleci.com/gh/Financial-Times/annotations-publisher)

## Service endpoints

For a full description of API endpoints for the service, please see the [Open API specification](./api/api.yml).

### POST
####Publish from Store####

```
curl http://localhost:8080/draft/content/b7b871f6-8a89-11e4-8e24-00144feabdc0/annotations/publish?fromStore=true -XPOST
```

–ê POST request with fromSource=true retrieves the latest annotations from draft-annotations-api, persists them to the PAC database draft and published-annotations tables, and then publishes them to UPP.

####Publish with Body####

This endpoint first saves in PAC the annotations provided in the body and then does the same as Publish from Store.
N.B.: Currently, if the hash value is empty, the request will succeed anyway. This may change in the future.

curl http://localhost:8080/draft/content/b7b871f6-8a89-11e4-8e24-00144feabdc0/annotations/publish -XPOST -H "Previous-Document-Hash:hashvalue" --data
'{
```
{
      "annotations":[
      {
        "predicate": "http://www.ft.com/ontology/annotation/hasContributor",
        "id": "http://www.ft.com/thing/5bd49568-6d7c-3c10-a5b0-2f3fd5974a6b",
      },
      {
        "predicate": "http://www.ft.com/ontology/annotation/about",
        "id": "http://www.ft.com/thing/d7de27f8-1633-3fcc-b308-c95a2ad7d1cd",
      },
      {
        "predicate": "http://www.ft.com/ontology/annotation/hasDisplayTag",
        "id": "http://www.ft.com/thing/d7de27f8-1633-3fcc-b308-c95a2ad7d1cd",
      }
    ]
}
```
}'

## Healthchecks

Admin endpoints are:

`/__gtg`
`/__health`
`/__build-info`

At the moment the `/__health` endpoint checks the availability of the UPP Publishing cluster's `publish` category, and the `/__gtg` performs no checks (effectively a ping of the service).

### Logging

* The application uses [logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus); the log file is initialised in [main.go](main.go).
* Logs are written to console.
* NOTE: `/__build-info` and `/__gtg` endpoints are not logged as they are called every second from varnish/vulcand and this information is not needed in logs/splunk.
